# Countries to display in an HTML form select list
# This property lists the countries that should be represented in the 
# auto-generated HTML select component retrieved by getSelectList().  
# Countries are given by their ISO Top Level Domain (TLD) 2-letter
# abbreviations but are shown using their full display names (see the 
# previous property).  The ISO 3166 TLD mapping can be found at 
# http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm.
# An "XX" entry means "Other" should be given as an option.  Countries are 
# displayed in the order listed here, allowing you to put commonly selected
# countries at the top.  The default value below lists all countries in
# alphabetical order except for the United States and Canada which are 
# listed first.
